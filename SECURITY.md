# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We take security very seriously and are committed to providing security updates for our project. 
However, we only support stable releases and do NOT provide security updates for alpha, beta, or pre-release versions.

The following versions of our project are currently supported with security updates:

| Version       | Supported          |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.1-alpha.4 | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.0.1-alpha.3 | :x:                |
| 1.0.1-alpha.2 | :x:                |
| 1.0.1-alpha.1 | :x:                |
| 1.0.1-alpha.0 | :x:                |

As alpha.4 is the latest version, we provide support for the version, until the next version is out.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in our project, we encourage you to report it to us immediately.
